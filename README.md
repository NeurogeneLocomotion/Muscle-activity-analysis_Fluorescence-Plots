# Muscle-activity-analysis_Fluorescence-Plots
Code for ploting Fluorescence traces of muscle actvity

System Requirements: Windows 10 or macOS Python 3.4.6

Instalation Time: No Instalation needed

Demo: 
Input files: Excel Files with fluorescence traces for each muscle processed in FIJI
Import the Mean fluorescence for each ROI drawn around each muscle, and frame number. 
Fluorescence values for each muscle were normalized by subtracting the minimum value of each video and dividing by the maximum value, giving contraction values between 0 and 100%.
Final output: Plot with Fluorescence traces for each muscle (Depressor and elevator) for one fly. 



Instructions for use: Define dataframe variable: Name of file and sheet name and run the code.
